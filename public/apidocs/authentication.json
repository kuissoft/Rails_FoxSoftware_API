The headers follow the RFC 6750 Bearer Token format:</p>\n\n        <p>Authentication headers example:</p>\n        <pre><code class='ruby'>{\n          \"access-token\": \"wwwww\",\n          \"client\":       \"xxxxx\",\n          \"expiry\":       \"yyyyy\",\n          \"uid\":          \"zzzzz\"\n        }</code></pre>\n\n        <p>The authentication headers consists of the following params:</p>\n\n        <table><thead>\n          <tr>\n          <th>param</th>\n          <th>description</th>\n          </tr>\n          </thead><tbody>\n          <tr>\n          <td><strong><code>access-token</code></strong></td>\n          <td>This serves as the user's password for each request.
